# Wi-Fi Direct App

This app was wrote for my undergraduate final year project. The app can transfer files between android devices by **Wi-Fi P2P technology**.



## Functions should be implemented

1. **All** kinds of files can be transferred.
2. Two-way transmission.
3. For some specific types, such as images, user can transfer **several** images in one transmission.
4. All clients can transfer files to group owner. (Not determined) 
5. An **elegant** UI and a **smooth** operation experience.

Function 1，2，3 and 4 were finished.
